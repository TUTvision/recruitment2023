We are seeking new PhD students to our computer vision and machine learning research teams in Helsinki and Tampere in Finland. 

The positions will offer excellent opportunities to work in a team of professionals responsible for developing cutting edge computer vision and machine learning technology, and allows you to learn many aspects from fundamental research problems to concrete applications. 

## Applicant

We welcome applications with any research focus related to computer vision and machine learning. In addition, we are especially seeking candidates with the following research focus:

- Large-scale multi modal learning (e.g. audio, visual, and language)
- Deep learning based 3D scene reconstruction
- Augmented reality for games and mobile applications (Android and/or iOS) 

Ideal candidate has a strong programming and mathematics background. Experience in (or strong will to learn) programming with Python or C++/Java are considered as advantages. 

## Team and research

The doctoral candidates will be supervised by [Professor Esa Rahtu](http://esa.rahtu.fi) (Tampere University) and [Associate Professor Juho Kannala](https://users.aalto.fi/~kannalj1/) (Aalto University). We work broadly in the fields of computer vision and machine learning. We are pursuing research problems in geometric computer vision (including topics such as visual SLAM, visual-inertial odometry, and 3D scene reconstruction), in semantic computer vision (including topics such as image-based localization, object detection and recognition, and deep learning), and large-scale multi modal learning (including audio-visual sound source separation, visually guided sound generatio, and audio-visual synchronization). More information of our research is available on our web pages linked below. (You can follow the links by clicking the images.)
